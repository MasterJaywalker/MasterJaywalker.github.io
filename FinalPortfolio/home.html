                <div class="partial">
                    <p>I am a born and raised Idahoan living in Nampa, Idaho. I graduated from Skyview in 2016 and went to CWI immediately after. I attended 
                        for two years focusing on general education and was able to take one semester of the Software Development course offered and found 
                        an interest in coding and web-design. Unfortunately several challenges presented themselves to me at that time and I had to take a 
                        hiatus from college.
                    </p>

                            <p>
                                After my short time at CWI I went on to become a plumber for an outfit in Nampa, a lube technician at Einstein's Oilery, and a 
                                bulk receiver at Darigold. I am a dog lover with two pups, Indigo and Auggie, and a loving fiance to my partner of four years, 
                                Ashlyn Fear. Through time and hard work I have earned everything I've ever wanted: my own pickup truck, 
                                a loving family, and purchased my first home in 2019.

                                <p>
                                    I am now almost 25 and after working in the service industry for many years I know what I want in life. My goal is to pursue an 
                                    education in Software Development and become a back-end programmer. I find enjoyment in the challenges object-oriented programming 
                                    presents and I love problem-solving. I know that the path ahead of me will be difficult and will require hard work, but I have 
                                    accomplished everything I've set out for myself thus-far and I'm ready for whatever comes my way.
