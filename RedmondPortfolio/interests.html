                    <h2>Camping and Exploring</h2><br>
                    <p>I find that living in Idaho provides endless opportunity to spend time outdoors. I have never had a liking for hunting or fishing 
                        but I love being in the sun whether I'm hiking, off-roading, swimming, or spending a weekend living among nature. Whether it's a small 
                        hike up Table Rock in Boise or appreciating the gorgeous views of the sawtooths, all of us have the opportunity to enjoy the nature 
                        of our back yard!

                    <h2>Cars and Trucks</h2><br>
                    <p>I've been working on vehicles since High School and find it very rewarding to know how to fix something yourself. My first car project was 
                        a 1999 Toyota Camry that had a damaged engine that I needed to fix if I wanted to have a ride while I was in school, and after discovering 
                        the joy that modifying vehicles gave me I've been upgrading my cars ever since. Anyone can get a start in modifying or general maintenance 
                        from a quick YouTube video!

                    <h2>Fitness and Bodybuilding</h2><br>
                    <p>Being that I had an upbringing playing football and baseball in my neighborhood culdesac I found great joy in competition and sports. I 
                        played baseball for 3 years in high school and started weight lifting to become bigger and stronger. The discipline and rigidity of body 
                        building taught me a work ethic that I've carried with me in everything I do.
